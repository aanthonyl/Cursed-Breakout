[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]There's no hope for this world you know. I don't know why you're still going.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]Why? Why are you doing this?
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]This world has created horrible things Victoria.
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]Hatred, war, the only way to salvation...
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]...Is to start over.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]What?
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]Don't you get it? We are not able to save ourselves, we have to commune with outside sources. The Great Old ones.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]No! That's wrong! We have to try!
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]We can keep the good alive, you can't just give up Strickland!
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]How naive...
