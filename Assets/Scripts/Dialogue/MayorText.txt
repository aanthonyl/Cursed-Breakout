[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Canary]Well, well, Victoria. You’ve caused quite a fuss amongst my men.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]Strickland! What are you doing here?
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Canary]Oh, just wanted to see you with my own eyes. I must say, I’m not impressed. You are nothing.
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Canary]You can’t possibly fathom the power I wield. Give up now and your death will only be slightly excruciating.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]Never! I won’t let you ruin my home!
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Canary]“Let me?” Hah! My reign is inevitable. I won’t even waste my time killing you.
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Canary]You will fall to my minions and I will delight in lifting that plant from your corpse!
