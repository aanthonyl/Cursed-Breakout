[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]Victoria. I'm surprised you've made it this far. Perhaps you are not nothing. You are less than nothing.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]Enough, Stickland. Get out of the way.
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]You're in no place to make commands. Surrender the plant or suffer.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]Never!
[NAME=Mayor Strickland][SPEAKERSPRITE=Mayor Strickland]Then you've chosen your fate.
