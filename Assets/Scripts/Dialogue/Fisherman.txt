[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]Hi Captain Randy. How’s today’s catch?
[NAME=Captain Randy][SPEAKERSPRITE=Captain Randy]Everything rots. Everything dies. Eternally, I am here, fishing.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]Erm? Randy? Are you feeling alright?
[NAME=Captain Randy][SPEAKERSPRITE=Captain Randy]My belly is full. I consume the rot and the rot consumes me. Forever and ever.
[NAME=Captain Randy][SPEAKERSPRITE=Captain Randy]Join me.
[NAME=Victoria][SPEAKERSPRITE=Victoria]Uh, perhaps another time?
[NAME=Captain Randy][SPEAKERSPRITE=Captain Randy]Of course. The rot is everlasting.
